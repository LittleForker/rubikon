About
=====

Rubikon is a simple to use, yet powerful Ruby framework for building
console-based applications.

Rubikon is still in an early development stage.

Installation
============

You can install Rubikon using RubyGem. This is the easiest way of installing
and recommended for most users.

{% highlight bash %}
  $ gem install rubikon
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to use the development code you should clone the Git repository:

{% highlight bash %}
  $ git clone git://github.com/koraktor/rubikon.git
  $ cd rubikon
  $ rake install
{% endhighlight %}

Requirements
============

* Any other operating system which has a usable console and is supported by a
  compatible Ruby implementation
* Ruby 1.8.6 or newer (see the [wiki][1] for more details)

Right now, Rubikon doesn't have any dependencies. So there's nothing else to
worry about.
