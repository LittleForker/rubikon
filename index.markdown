About
=====

Rubikon is a simple to use, yet powerful Ruby framework for building
console-based applications.

Installation
============

You can install Rubikon using RubyGem. This is the easiest way of installing
and recommended for most users.

{% highlight bash %}
    $ gem install rubikon
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to use the development code you should clone the Git repository:

{% highlight bash %}
    $ git clone git://github.com/koraktor/rubikon.git
    $ cd rubikon
    $ rake install
{% endhighlight %}

Requirements
============

The Rubikon gem doesn't have any dependencies. Everything you need is a sane
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) environment including
[RubyGems](http://www.rubygems.org). Any Ruby version from 1.8.6 onwards is
supported.

If you want to work with the source code you will need
[Git](http://git-scm.com) and
[Jeweler](http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler).
