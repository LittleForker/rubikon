Creating a Rubikon application is as simple as creating a Ruby class:

{% highlight ruby %}
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rubikon'

  class MyApplication < Rubikon::Application::Base
  end
{% endhighlight %}

If you save this code in a file called myapp.rb you can run it using
`ruby myapp.rb`. Or you could even add a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env ruby`) to the
top of the file and make it executable. You would then be able to run it even
more easily by typing `./myapp.rb`.

Now go on and define what your application should do when the user runs it.
This is done using `default` inside your application class:

{% highlight ruby %}
  default "Let's greet the world." do
    puts 'Hello World!'
  end
{% endhighlight %}

If you run this application it will just print `Hello World!`.

Ok, this is nothing special, but you can also add command-line arguments to
your application using `command` inside your class:

{% highlight ruby %}
  command :hello, "Let's greet the world." do
    puts 'Hello World!'
  end
{% endhighlight %}

This way your application would do nothing when called without arguments, but
it would print `Hello World!` when called using `ruby myapp.rb hello`. A
command is code that is executed when the application is called with the
command's name as the first argument â€“ just like RubyGem's `install` or Git's
`commit`.

Another part of Rubikon's DSL are flags and options. Both are parameter types
that change the behaviour of the application. While a flag is a parameter
without arguments, an option may take one or more additional arguments. Typical
examples for flags are `--debug` or `--verbose` (or short `-d` and `-v`).
RubyGem's `--version` is an example for an option that requires additional
arguments. Flags and options are easily added to your application's commands
using Rubikon's DSL and can also be easily accessed in the context of your
commands:

{% highlight ruby %}
  flag :more, 'Greet even nicer'
  option :name, 'Somebody special to greet', :first, :last
  command :hello, "Let's greet the world or somebody special." do
    who = (given? name) ? "#{name.first} #{name.last}" : 'World'
    puts "Hello #{who}!"
    puts 'Nice to see you.' if given? more
  end
{% endhighlight %}

But Rubikon allows a lot more than just defining command-line arguments. It
will also generate help screens, load and write configuration files, handle
user input and more. See the
